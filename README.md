Include a README file (DevCatalyst) 

The only thing that will be different from that lesson, is the inclusion of a README file. The video walks you through how to make one, but for the competition you will use this file to brag on yourself! State all of your names and your school and let us know what each of you worked on. Especially include details where you went above and beyond for the project. Did you have any difficult problems that you had to overcome? Did you create custom images or videos for your client? Did you discover that you love coding? Let the judges know! There are no requirements for this section other than your name and your school, but it is to your advantage to give a little information about yourself. 


 

README file Examples 

We chose our color scheme because the colors in it were the colors our client included in his logo, and we thought that by keeping the colors the same, the website would look more uniform. We could not find the actual font that our client used in his logo, but we used the closest font we had access to and that looked most pleasing. We kept the background white and simple because again it went well with our client's logo, and our client preferred it to be that way. Overall, we wanted to incorporate all of our client's beliefs into our website, from his business practices to his beliefs about his future to the meaningful relationships he has with others. 

When we checked for responsiveness with the Developer Tools, our website was responsive across all devices. However, when we actually tested our website to see how it looked on certain mobile devices, it did not look as good as we had hoped in portrait mode. It is best viewed in landscape mode. 

We do not feel that our website is content-heavy, but we designed it this way because doing so was what our client wanted. Our client mainly uses his social media to advertise his business, and our website serves as a simple way to enhance his mobile image/presence. 

Though our team was composed of different individuals with differing ideas and outcomes, over the course of making our website, we all worked together and shared ideas that we all thought would work best. Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity and helping us see the many opportunities that coding can offer. We sincerely hope you enjoy our website.

We would like to thank Dev Catalyst for allowing us to be a part of this competition. It was such an amazing experience to create a web page that embodies our newfound talent and our ingenuity. We hope that you enjoy viewing our website as much as we were delighted in constructing it. 


-----------------------------
We learned a lot about coding while creating this website.  Looking back, we are amazed that we built this website from scratch and we are very proud of how it turned out.  Both of us learned the benefits of working together and the importance of each of our unique talents. 

We hope you enjoy reviewing our website.

The Trifocals

We chose our color theme because our client did not like the original colors that he had on his business card. He told us to be creative, and as a group we all decided on a blueish color. Amaya wanted a darker blue, and Jadin wanted a light blue. Johnia made a statement that we should compromise and that is what we did. So, that is how we agreed on our color theme. 

 

The responsiveness of our page took the longest because the media queries were not working. Eventually we got someone to come to help us with working on viewports and screen sizes. This made an enormous difference to the production because we were stuck on the media queries. Then when we converted it over to GitHub (the website that we use to submit our website), it stopped working again. We continued to troubleshoot, eventually we worked out that we needed to change the amount of pixels that were originally used. 

 

Our team has had different perspectives on a lot of things, but in the end we always came up with a solution. At first we didn't know each other. Now we've become closer through teamwork and newfound friendships.

We are the Trifocals of JCM Early College.

It has been an adventure creating our first website!  Our first client quit corresponding with us so we had to find a new client and start over.  This client is a trucking company.  

Our website is not content heavy as our client's wish was for a simple, clean website.  We included the basic information he sent us on the Home Page, About Page, and Contact Page.  He told us to be creative with our design.  For example, he did not like the colors on his business card.  This led our team to choose a blue hue for part of our design.  We compromised on a shade of blue to choose our color theme.  We each worked on one page and at the end put them all together.

We chose a font that we thought looked most pleasing. We kept the background white and simple because of our client's wishes.  We used Bootstrap for our Nav Bar and are pleased with how it turned out. A form was used on the Contact page to show the business hours.  Getting our page to be responsive took us awhile.  We think we finally have media queries figured out.

Our team has had different perspectives on a lot of things, but in the end we always came up with a solution. At first we didn't know each other. Now we have become close through teamwork and are good friends.
